## ✍️ Writing Principles

### 1. Write for Humans
- Use conversational language
- Avoid jargon and technical terms
- Write like you're talking to a friend

**Instead of:** "Initiate service request submission"
**Write:** "Book your service"

### 2. Be Concise
- Get to the point quickly
- Remove unnecessary words
- Use shorter sentences

**Instead of:** "In order to proceed with booking your lawn mowing service, you will need to select a date"
**Write:** "Choose your lawn mowing date"

### 3. Be Specific
- Use concrete examples
- Provide clear instructions
- Avoid vague language

**Instead of:** "Contact us soon"
**Write:** "Call us at (555) 123-4567 or email hello@lawnguru.com"

### 4. Focus on Benefits
- Lead with what the user gains
- Explain the "why"
- Make it personal

**Instead of:** "Our service includes weekly mowing"
**Write:** "Enjoy a perfectly manicured lawn every week"

### 5. Use Active Voice
- Subject performs the action
- More direct and engaging

**Instead of:** "Your lawn will be mowed by our team"
**Write:** "Our team will mow your lawn"
